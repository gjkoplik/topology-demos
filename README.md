# topology-demos

A repository for generating the figures for
[Persistent Homology: A Non-Mathy Introduction with Examples](https://towardsdatascience.com/persistent-homology-with-examples-1974d4b9c3d0)
on Towards Data Science on Medium.
This repo covers some of the basic topology concepts used at [Geometric Data Analytics](https://geomdata.com/).

NOTE: this code was mostly written in 2019 (`./runners/signal_compression.py` has been updated since
the publishing of the Medium article though). This repository was never meant for public release, so the code / usability is not nearly as
clean as it should be. Furthermore, the code, the `conda` environment, and the interaction of the two have not
(and will not) be maintained.

Any figures / gifs from the Medium post are generated by scripts in `./runners` for replicability at the time of development.

Code was written to run in the `conda` environment specified by `topology_demos_env.yml`. It can be installed by running:

```bash
cd <path/to/topology/demos>
bash install_env.sh
```

To uninstall the `conda` environment, run:

```bash
cd <path/to/topology/demos>
bash uninstall_env.sh
```

All runners are designed to run from the root of the repo, e.g.:

```bash
cd <path/to/topology/demos>
export PYTHONPATH=$pwd:$PYTHONPATH
python ./runners/<runner>.py
```

All code added to `./sandbox` will be gitignored.
